Object Tracking with YOLOv5
This repository contains code for object tracking using YOLOv5, a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm. YOLOv5 is a deep learning-based model that can detect and track objects in real-time with high accuracy.

Setup
Follow these steps to set up the environment and run the code:

Create a virtual environment using Python 3:

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv Yolov5env
Activate the newly created environment (for Unix/Linux):

bash
Copy code
source Yolov5env/bin/activate
Clone the YOLOv5 repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5  # clone
Move the necessary files to the YOLOv5 directory:

bash
Copy code
mv object-Tracking.py objectdetection.ipynb yolov5/
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Navigate to the YOLOv5 directory:

bash
Copy code
cd yolov5
Usage
Once the setup is complete, you can run the object tracking code provided in the object-Tracking.py file or explore the object detection notebook objectdetection.ipynb. Make sure to follow the instructions within the code or notebook for proper usage and customization.
